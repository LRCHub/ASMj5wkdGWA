Slave to my emotions
I feel when you flying
And there with you
I' am flying too...
I am lost
Can tell but feel what you do

Slave to my emotions
I see yours sad eyes
And know that if I could only hold you
Then you where know that I am always on your side
Flying I can carry
Nobody else
I can really lift off my self (despegarme de mí misma)
Lift off my self

Well upset to much already
And yet you won't let me in
I know that I need to know you
But don't nowhere to begin
Then i fall asleep and you are there
In my dreams everyday every nigth
And you're reacher
And touchme ask me why we never talk
And then I walk away

Well upset to much already
And yet you won't let me in
I know that I need to know you
But don't nowhere to begin
Then I fall asleep and you are there
In my dreams everyday every nigth
And you're reacher
And touchme ask me why we never talk
And then I walk away

Slave to my emotions
But I live a dream that
I had before
I have one much more
But you're powerless
Um um um um um...
