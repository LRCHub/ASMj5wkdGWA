The echo of your touch still lingers
Even though you moved long ago
As the sun goes down on everything that's us
You already captured another heart
Broken mirror, a million reflections
Cutting me down like knives
And its aiming at my heart

Now I know that your heart is just emotions away from here
Now I see that your touch is just emotions away from me
Emotions away
Emotions away
Emotions away
Emotions away

Now I know that your heart is just emotions away from here
Now I see that your touch is just emotions away from me
Emotions away
Emotions away
Emotions away
Emotions away
